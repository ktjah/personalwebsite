<h1 style="background-color:LightBlue;">My Family</h1>
<p>I am an only child. I've experienced siblinghood briefly when my cousin lived with me for a while. 
I am forever grateful to experience it but I cannot deny how good the only child life is. I think my parents can agree as well.</p>
<p>My family of 3 only consist of my Mama, my Papa, and me :)</p>
<p>(My parent aren't comfortable with their full names online, sorry!)</p>
