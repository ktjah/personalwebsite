<p>As stated, my name is <b>Khadijah Sofea</b>. But I go by <b>KT</b>!</p>
<p>I am 20 years old, born and raised in Putrajaya my whole life. If you are into zodiacs, I am a Scorpio.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My hobbies includes drawing and "Lego" building. I used to draw all the time, but I now draw once in a while since I'm quite busy.
The "Lego" builds I've done aren't officially Legos, just knock offs. However they are cheap and has sets of my favourite characters so I am satisfied. 
My collection of them is growing more and more.</p>
<p> I am in a lot of fandoms, currently I am obssesed with "Epic: The Musical". It is still in production, I can't wait for it to be complete!
I think the cast behind it are incredibly talented.</p> <p style="background-color:LightBlue;">My favourite songs from the musical are: </p>
